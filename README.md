# CS 464 Homework 2 LogisticRegression

Required programming language: Python (Python3 needs to be installed on the computer)

Required libraries: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn (sys library is used to exit if the file path is incorrect)

The program consists of the main file (mainLR.py) and the file that includes the Logistic Regression class (LogisticRegression.py). 
Additionally, a notebook file (notebookLR.ipynb) also added to ease the readiness of the code.

How to execute: If the libraries are not installed, use the command 'pip install x' in the command window.
From the terminal/command window run mainLR.py with the command 'python mainLR.py'. It is needed to input the file 
locations/directories of the image folder and the original image path, respectively. If the directory is wrong, the program ends.
Example path is: 'C:\Users\gulce\Desktop\EEE 8TH SEMESTER\CS 464\Homeworks\HW2\dataset.csv'. For the notebook, it can be 
opened with Jupyter or Google Colab.

Outputs: The program will display validation vs. epoch graphs, confusion matrices, accuracy values, metrics. The plots 
are displayed at the end of the program.

To rerun the program, it is needed to close all the plot figures.
